Redbubble is a Ruby CLI to generate browsable html files from Redbubble's **works** XML files.

![Interface](https://github.com/maukoquiroga/redbubble/raw/master/screenshots/index.png)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'redbubble'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install redbubble


## Usage

Run:

    $ redbubble -f input.xml -o output

Both arguments are required. You can get a copy of `works.xml` from Redbubbleâ„¢. As for `output`, it should be a path and not a file, as multiple HTML files are created in batch.
